# ML
Contains a collection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, generic to solving a wide range of problems. 

1. MNIST has the code for a 3 layer Neural Network which works on the real math, without having used any libraries. The current code is modified to solve the MNIST Handwritten digits classification problem, can be easily modified, for any other DL image classification model.
2. CNN_cat_dog is an image classifier to classify images of dogs and cats. It uses keras with tensorflow as the background.
3. ANN_tabular is a simple artificial neural network, used to predict the binary outputs from a tabular data file, in this case the data was will a bank customer leave the bank, given certain features.
