# ML
Contains a collection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, generic to solving a wide range of problems. 

1. NN_without_libraries has the code for a 3 layer Neural Network which works on the real math, without having used any libraries. The current code is modified to solve the MNIST Handwritten digits classification problem, can be easily modified, for any other DL image classification model.
