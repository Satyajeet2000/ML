# ML
Contains a collection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, generic to solving a wide range of problems. 

1. MNIST has the code for a 3 layer Neural Network which works on the real math, without having used any libraries. The current code is modified to solve the MNIST Handwritten digits classification problem, can be easily modified, for any other DL image classification model.
3. Customer_Loyalty is an artificial neural network built in keras, using TensorFlow as backend. It is trained on a real dataset to predict if a customer will leave the bank or continue, based on multiple features such as salary, age, etc.
